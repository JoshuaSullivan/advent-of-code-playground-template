# Advent of Code Template

A template Playground for solving Advent of Code challenges in Swift.

Included:

- Multi-page setup including template page headers.
- Data parser for converting the raw input file to usable Swift types.
- Includes the Swift Algorithms (https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) library, which is very useful for many puzzle types.

**Note:** You should try to do most of the computational work for each challenge in the "Solver.swift" file found in "Sources". Code in the "Sources" folder is run without logging and executes over 10x faster than code in the playground's pages.
